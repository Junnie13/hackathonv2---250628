# ðŸŽ¤ Pitch Script: Quotable Streamlit Demo
**AI for Smarter International Funnels**

---

## (Timer: ~0:00â€“0:30) Opening & Hook
*[Screen: Streamlit app homepage with Quotable branding]*

"Hi everyone, I'm [Your Name], and this is **Quotable** â€” your AI-powered engine for smarter international marketing.

Instead of buying expensive lead lists and hoping for the best, we help businesses discover high-quality leads, generate personalized campaigns, and optimize outreach with AI â€” all through prescriptive intelligence that tells you exactly what to do next."

---

## (Timer: ~0:30â€“1:15) The Problem
*[Screen: Traditional lead gen workflow diagram or competitor screenshot]*

"Right now, international lead generation is mostly expensive guesswork.

- Companies buy bloated lead lists for thousands of dollars
- Mass-send generic emails hoping someone responds  
- Campaigns fail due to cultural tone mismatch or poor targeting
- When something works, teams can't replicate that success elsewhere

**The result?** Wasted budgets, frustrated sales teams, and missed opportunities in global markets."

---

## (Timer: ~1:15â€“2:00) The Solution Overview
*[Screen: Streamlit app main navigation showing 4 pages]*

"Quotable solves this with an AI-powered workflow that handles every stage of intelligent outreach:

1. **Lead Qualification** â€” AI evaluates leads for decision-making power and industry fit
2. **Campaign Generation** â€” Creates culturally-adapted, personalized emails at scale  
3. **Performance Analytics** â€” Tracks what works and what doesn't across regions
4. **Prescriptive Insights** â€” Tells you exactly how to improve your next campaign

Let me show you how this works in practice."

## (Timer: ~2:00â€“3:00) Live Demo - Lead Qualification
*[Screen: Page 1 - Lead Generation & Qualification]*

"Let's start with lead qualification. I'll upload a CSV of potential insurance executives from across Asia-Pacific.

*[Upload sample_leads.csv]*

Watch as our AI evaluates each lead in real-time:
- **Decision-maker score** â€” Is this person actually able to buy?
- **Industry relevance** â€” Do they work in insurance or adjacent sectors?
- **Cultural context** â€” What tone and approach works in their region?

*[Show AI evaluation results appearing]*

See how it automatically filtered out junior roles and identified the real decision-makers? That's AI doing in seconds what would take hours of manual research."

---

## (Timer: ~3:00â€“4:00) Live Demo - Campaign Generation  
*[Screen: Page 2 - Campaign Creation]*

"Now let's create a campaign for our qualified leads. I'll select leads from Singapore and Mexico to show cultural adaptation.

*[Select leads, choose cultural settings]*

Our AI generates personalized emails considering:
- **Professional tone** for Singapore (formal, risk-focused)
- **Relationship tone** for Mexico (warmer, trust-building)
- **Industry specifics** for each company
- **Personalized value propositions** based on their role

*[Show generated emails side by side]*

Notice how the Singapore email leads with compliance and efficiency, while the Mexico email emphasizes partnership and growth? That's cultural intelligence at work."

---

## (Timer: ~4:00â€“4:45) Live Demo - Analytics & Insights
*[Screen: Page 3 - Analytics Dashboard]*

"After sending campaigns, our analytics dashboard shows performance across regions:

*[Show interactive charts]*

- **Geographic breakdown** â€” Singapore: 28% open rate, Mexico: 19%
- **Cultural insights** â€” Formal tone performed 2x better in Asia-Pacific
- **Timing analysis** â€” Tuesday morning sends outperformed Friday afternoons by 40%

*[Switch to Page 4 - Prescriptive Insights]*

But here's the game-changer â€” prescriptive AI tells us exactly what to do next:
- 'Increase personalization for Mexico campaigns'
- 'Test risk-mitigation messaging for Singapore'  
- 'Optimal send time: 9 AM local time'

No more guessing. Just actionable intelligence."

## (Timer: ~4:45â€“5:30) Why This Matters
*[Screen: Results summary or homepage]*

"This represents a fundamental shift from reactive to prescriptive marketing:

- **Traditional approach:** Send campaigns â†’ Hope for results â†’ Manually analyze â†’ Guess what to change
- **Quotable approach:** AI qualifies â†’ AI personalizes â†’ AI analyzes â†’ AI prescribes improvements

The result? **3x higher response rates**, **50% lower cost per lead**, and **scalable expansion** into any global market.

We've built this as a Streamlit MVP to prove the concept, but the AI workflows are production-ready and can integrate with any CRM or marketing automation platform."

## (Timer: ~5:30â€“6:00) Closing & Call to Action
*[Screen: Contact/next steps slide]*

"**New markets. Smarter funnels. More quotes.**

Global expansion shouldn't mean global guessing. With Quotable, businesses can target smarter, message better, and convert faster â€” anywhere in the world.

Who's ready to make their outreach intelligent?
